# Aarohi – AI for Women’s Health

## Problem Statement
Women often face delayed diagnosis of health conditions such as anemia, PCOS, thyroid disorders, and menstrual irregularities due to lack of awareness and personalized healthcare guidance. Existing health applications are generic and reactive, offering limited predictive insights.

## Solution Overview
Aarohi is an AI-powered women’s health risk prediction and guidance system. It uses a custom machine learning model to analyze user symptoms, lifestyle factors, and menstrual cycle data to predict early health risk levels and provide preventive recommendations.

## AI Approach
- Custom supervised machine learning model
- Problem type: Health risk classification
- Output: Low / Medium / High risk level
- Focus on early detection and prevention

## System Architecture
The system consists of:
- Mobile/Web User Interface
- Backend API for request handling
- ML Model Service for prediction
- Secure Database for encrypted data storage
- Security and Privacy layer ensuring consent and access control

## Ethical Considerations
- User consent is mandatory
- All health data is encrypted
- Bias mitigation strategies considered
- AI outputs are explainable and advisory, not diagnostic

## Note
This repository represents a conceptual and prototype-level implementation created for hackathon ideation purposes.
